# WatermelonDS Emufii Edition

This fork of WatermelonDS exists only to be used with [Emufii](https://github.com/jojodogm-ctrl/emufii). It adds the netplay that lets two to four players use DS local wireless over the internet, and Emufii needs it for its remote local wireless sessions. Without this build, DS games in Emufii only have Wi-Fi Connection play.

> ⚠️ **This fork is temporary.** SapphireRhodonite, who maintains WatermelonDS, has been sent the netplay code. Once an official WatermelonDS release includes it, this fork won't be needed anymore: switch back to the official app and Emufii will use it.

You don't need to set anything up in the emulator. Install it, point it to your ROM folder, and Emufii launches it and connects the players for you.

Download the APK from the [releases page](https://github.com/jojodogm-ctrl/WatermelonDS/releases/latest). It installs next to the official WatermelonDS, it is not an update of it. Keep your official app: nothing is replaced and nothing has to be uninstalled.

Why: this build has its own package name, `me.magnum.melondualds.emufii`, and its own signing key. Android sees it as a separate app, so it gets its own storage and settings, and your official WatermelonDS, with its saves, settings and save states, stays exactly as it is. Using the official package name would have meant uninstalling the official app first, which wipes its internal data. Emufii looks for this package first and falls back to the official one.

If you want WatermelonDS on its own, use the official version by SapphireRhodonite, linked below. Everything else in this README is from the original project.

# WatermelonDS
A Nintendo DS and DSi emulator for Android, built on top of [melonDS](https://melonds.kuribo64.net/) and the
[melonDS Android port](https://github.com/rafaelvcaetano/melonDS-android) by rafaelvcaetano.

WatermelonDS is a fork that keeps up with upstream while adding RetroAchievements (including offline play), a Vulkan
renderer, RetroArch shader presets and full external display support, wrapped in its own visual identity.

# What WatermelonDS adds
Everything from the upstream Android port, plus:

### RetroAchievements
*  Achievements, leaderboards and Hardcore mode, with a shared card style for the in-game popups
*  Your profile and score are shown on load and in the settings screen
*  **Offline play**: unlocks earned without a connection are stored and submitted later. Two providers are available
   the one built into WatermelonDS, or [RAOfflineProxy](https://github.com/SapphireRhodonite) if you prefer to run it
   yourself. Note that RAOfflineProxy does not support Hardcore mode
*  Achievements can be disabled without logging out, and sessions start even for games that have no achievement set

### Renderers
*  Software, OpenGL, Vulkan and compute renderers, with internal resolution scaling
*  Vulkan gained a *fastpath* presentation profile, optimized texture uploads and dynamic scissor clipping
*  **RetroArch shader presets** on every renderer, through [librashader](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/librashader)
*  Adrenotools driver support on the `gitHub` flavor, for custom Adreno drivers

### External displays
*  Play on a second screen (TV, dock, devices such as the Odin 2), with the touch screen still usable on the handheld
*  Per-ROM external screen and layout settings, screen rotation, backgrounds, video filtering and aspect ratio control
*  Achievements are shown on the external display while you browse your ROM list

### Library and layouts
*  DSiWare titles in the ROM list, box art on the "continue" shelf, and custom ROM names
*  Layout editor with screen transparency, aspect ratio options and separate centering controls
*  Settings backup and restore (requires a restart to apply), with internal and external layouts backed up separately
*  Alternate input bindings and a hold-to-fast-forward button

The core is kept in sync with melonDS 1.0 and later upstream changes.

# Missing Features
*  Local Multiplayer
*  DSi SD card support
*  Customizable button skins

# Performance
Performance is solid on 64 bit devices with thread rendering and JIT enabled, and should run at full speed on flagship
devices. Performance on older devices, specially 32 bit devices, is very poor due to the lack of JIT support.

# Integration with third-party frontends
It's possible to launch WatermelonDS from third party frontends. For that, you will need to have the ROMs you want to
launch already scanned by WatermelonDS. Then, you can configure your third-party frontend with the following
configuration:
*  Package name: `me.magnum.melondualds` (nightly builds use `me.magnum.melondualds.nightly`)
*  Activity name: `me.magnum.melonds.ui.emulator.EmulatorActivity`
*  Parameters (choose one):
    * Intent data (preferred) - a URI of the NDS ROM (ZIP and 7z files are supported). Ensure [read permission is granted](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION)
    * `uri` (deprecated) - a string with the [SAF](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/create-document-provider) URI of the NDS ROM (ZIP and 7z files are supported)
    * `PATH` (deprecated) - a string with the absolute path to the NDS ROM (ZIP and 7z files are supported)


### Info regarding save files
When launching ROMs from third-party frontends, if WatermelonDS hasn't scanned that particular ROM previously, it won't
be able to create the save file next to the ROM file if the option "Save next to ROM file" is enabled in the settings or
the save file directory is not set. Instead, WatermelonDS will create a save file in
`Android/data/me.magnum.melondualds/files/saves`

# Releases

Builds are published [here](https://github.com/SapphireRhodonite/melonDS-android/releases). Release candidates are
marked as pre-releases; they can contain more bugs than usual and you may need to clear your app data to get them to
work properly after an update.

# Building
To build the project you will need the Android SDK, NDK, CMake, a JDK 21 toolchain and a Rust toolchain
(`cargo` and `rustup`), which is used to build librashader for each ABI.

## Build steps:
1.  Clone the project, including submodules with:
    
    `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SapphireRhodonite/melonDS-android.git`
2.  Install the Android SDK, NDK (`28.0.13004108`) and CMake
3.  Install Rust with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). If Android Studio does not inherit your shell `PATH`, set the
    `CARGO` and `RUSTUP` environment variables to the executable paths
4.  Build with:
    1.  Unix: `./gradlew :app:assembleGitHubProdDebug`
    2.  Windows: `gradlew.bat :app:assembleGitHubProdDebug`
5.  The generated APK can be found at `app/build/outputs/apk/gitHubProd/debug`

There are two flavor dimensions, so build tasks combine both: `gitHub` or `playStore` (the former enables adrenotools)
and `prod` or `nightly`. For example, `:app:assembleGitHubNightlyDebug` or `:app:assembleGitHubProdRelease`.

If you want to create a release build, you will need to modify your `local.properties` file to include the following fields:  
*  `MELONDS_KEYSTORE=<path_to_your_keystore>`
*  `MELONDS_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=<keystore_password>`
*  `MELONDS_KEY_ALIAS=<name_of_your_key_alias>`
*  `MELONDS_KEY_PASSWORD=<key_alias_password>`
